# Dataset Description

## Proteomics Dataset

**proteomics.txt**: This dataset contains proteomic profiles of 140 patients with bladder cancer. The proteomic data is the result of high-throughput mass spectrometry, which quantitatively measures the abundance of proteins in biological samples.

**Rows**: Each row represents a different protein.

**Columns**: The first column is the Protein ID, and each of the following columns represents a patient (labeled BC.1, BC.2, ..., BC.140).

**Entries**: The numerical values are the expression levels or abundances of each protein in each patient's sample.

## Metadata Dataset

**metadata.csv**: This file contains additional information about the 140 patients whose proteomic data you have. Common types of metadata include demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity), clinical data (tumor size, histological grade, lymph node involvement, metastasis, treatment and response, survival status), and lifestyle factors (smoking history, family history of cancer). This data can provide context to the proteomic data and may reveal important correlations.

# Subpopulation Identification

## Pipeline for clustering patients

### Preprocessing

- Transpose: make each column represent a protein, and each row a patient.
- Handling Missing Values: Not necessary, since there's no missing values.
- Normalization: Given the scale of proteomics data, normalization is crucial. StandardScaler may be a good choice.
- Feature Selection or Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is a common choice for dimensionality reduction, but with thousands of features, we need more sophisticated methods:
  - Sparse PCA: Efficient with high-dimensional data, retaining interpretability.
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Effective for high-dimensional datasets, particularly in visualizing clusters in lower-dimensional space.
  - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP): Similar to t-SNE but often better at preserving global structure.

### Clustering

- K-Means: A good starting point, but may not be optimal for high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality.
- Hierarchical Clustering: Useful for revealing hierarchical structures in data.
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Good for datasets with complex structures and noise.
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs): More flexible than K-Means, as it assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

### Determining the Number of Clusters

- Elbow Method: For K-Means, but may not be clear with high-dimensional data.
- Silhouette Score: As you mentioned, useful for assessing the quality of clusters.
- Calinski-Harabasz Index: Another metric to evaluate the cluster validity.
- Cluster Stability Assessment: Evaluating the consistency of clusters across different subsamples of our data can be informative.

### Iterative Approach

Iterate over above steps, different combinations of dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms can yield varying results.

### Visualization and Interpretation

Utilize visualization tools (like scatter plots from PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP reductions) to interpret and validate the clusters.
